# Nature Awards
 A playful & simple UI for practicing advanced CSS concepts, including:
 - Flexbox Parent & Child element positioning using auto margins and align-self.
 - Positioning: Relative, Absolute, Fixed
 - Troubleshooting whitespace with display
 - Mobile-first design
 
 # Concept
 A gallery of award winners for "Earth's Best Designs". This may or may not have been inspired by images I already had in my hard drive folders.
 
 # Next Steps Integration
 Though this was just a CSS mockup, I could see integrating:
 - Functional menu & buttons
 - An actual chat function
 - A gallery function for "runner-ups"
 - Smaller images on desktop, or a desktop-friendly gallery function.
